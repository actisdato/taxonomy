  - question: What is InstructLab?
    answer: |
      InstructLab is a mathodology that aims to provide a model-agnostic space from which anyone can learn
      and contribute to the evolution of LLM infrastructure.
  - question: How does InstructLab work?
    answer: |
      InstructLab uses a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method for Large Language Models.
  - question: What does the lab in InstructLab mean?
    answer: |
      The lab in InstructLab stands for Large-Scale Alignment for ChatBots.
  - question: What is ilab?
    answer: |
      ilab is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool that allows you to perfirm the following actions:
      1) Download a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM),
      2) Chat with the LLM.
  - question: What is InstructLab Taxonomy?
    answer: |
      InstructLab Taxonomy is a tree that allows you to create models tuned with
      your data (enhanced via synthetic data generation),
      using Large-Scale Alignment for ChatBots (LAB) method.
